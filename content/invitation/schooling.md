The Schooling Project, GCI's flagship initiative, focuses on enrolling children aged six years and above—including school dropouts, children forced into labour or children at risk of being trafficked—into formal education. The program supports the children to remain in school, by providing partial school fees, uniforms, and books. 

GCI actively engages families and communities, fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for ensuring the success of these services, thereby creating sustainable support systems for children in slum communities.
