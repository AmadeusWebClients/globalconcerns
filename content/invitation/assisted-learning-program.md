Global Concerns India (GCI) proudly offers the Assisted Learning Program, an enriching after-school initiative that complements traditional education. Conducted within the environment of government-aided school premises and at a dedicated GCI center in L.R. Nagar slum, this program is designed to elevate the competencies of children and young people. 

We focus on fostering creativity, critical thinking, organization, social and communication skills, adaptability, problem-solving, and democratic cooperation, all while promoting respectful and dignified interactions. Join us in making a lasting difference in the lives of our youth.

At ALLP, we passionately strive to create transformative experiences that not only empower children with essential life skills but also significantly enhance their overall quality of life and that of their families. 

Many of these children are first-generation learners who require additional academic support, which is addressed through the Assisted and Lifelong Learning Program (ALLP). The ALLP complements formal education by offering holistic interventions, including soft skills development, to help children overcome challenges such as:

* Lack of study space or guidance at home.
* Alcoholism within families, poses challenges to children to study.
* Limited support from working parents.

Through the ALLP, we are dedicated to creating transformative experiences that empower children with essential life skills, enhancing their overall quality of life and benefiting their families as well.
