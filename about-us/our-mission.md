# Our Mission

To mobilize people (with special focus on women, children and the marginalized) to be leaders with values, transforming every sphere of life. To empower them to be change agents and to engage with the governance of their cities and villages, systematically addressing inequality and injustice, and to connect them to making conscious decisions to be in harmony with the environment and nature.
