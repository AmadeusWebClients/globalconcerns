## Reflections on 2024

As we approach the end of another year, I find myself **reflecting on the challenges** we've faced, the victories we've **celebrated**, and the **immense support** that has made it all possible.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to the **governing board** and advisory **board members** of GlobalConcernsIndia.org for the trust they place in me and my team. Your belief in us fills me with **immense pride and deep gratitude**. Together, we've made strides toward creating positive change, and your continued support strengthens our resolve to do even more.

A special thank you goes to my husband, Narayan Adige, my children Sundar and Sushila, my brother Prem Mani, my sister Maria Subramanian, my sister-in-law Zeena, my nephews Evan Suchet and Elvin Suhail, and all the members of my extended family. Your unwavering love and encouragement are the foundation of my strength and determination.

I am endlessly inspired by the resilience of the **children, women, and families** we serve. From the students supported through our [Schooling Project](%url%schooling/) to the children thriving in our [Assisted and Lifelong Learning](%url%lifelong-learning/) and Nutrition Program, and to the mothers actively contributing to their children's holistic development at the Children's Creativity Centre your efforts have helped build a foundation of hope and endless possibilities.

Through strategic partnerships and focused initiatives like our [Ethical Digital & Safety](%url%creativity-center/digital-literacy/) and Transformative Leadership programs-supporting entrepreneurship, skill training and building collectives of domestic and unorganised workers; we continue to reduce inequities and move closer to building more inclusive and just societies. The collective action we champion fuels this progress and strengthens our shared vision.

Last year, we embarked on an important journey with Dhwani's two-year experiential program, **strengthening GCI's compliance, governance, and organizational practices**. As part of a long list of Dhwani's alumni, GCI is a **vibrant and credible NGO**, and we are proud to carry forward this **legacy of growth and accountability**.

We are also honoured to serve on key committees, such as the Karnataka State High Power Committee Against Human Trafficking, the District Legal Services Task Force in Bengaluru Urban, and the Bonded Labour Abolition Vigilance Committee in Bengaluru Rural. One of our staff members is appointed as a 'Support Person' under the POCSO Act, reinforcing our **commitment to justice**.

We are continually inspired by our co-founder and author, Alastair Christie, who believed that positive contributions grow stronger when people come together. His vision reminds us that paths can transform, and life should be celebrated in all its fullness, shared with gratitude.

Thank you for believing in us and walking this journey together. As we move into 2025 and beyond, we are excited to continue this shared vision of justice, equity, and compassion. With the courage of our convictions and the confidence of our friends, well-wishers, and beloved families, we are ready to make our dreams a reality.

Together, we will continue to shape a narrative of progress, equality, and hope - that will inspire generations to come.
