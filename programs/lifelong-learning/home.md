The _Assisted Learning Program_ focuses on addressing the formal school syllabus while encouraging lifelong learning. This initiative provides essential guidance and support to children enrolled in formal schools, offering them resources and opportunities to expand their knowledge.

The program creates a rich, literate environment by providing access to newspapers, newsletters, and information materials, thereby promoting multilingualism and equipping children to thrive in a globalized world.

## Key Features

*   Distribution of reading, writing, and learning materials.
*   Engaging children through interactive activities such as games and art.
*   Encouraging school attendance by providing snacks and eatables.
*   Organizing regular meetings with parents, particularly mothers, to foster involvement.
*   Promoting extracurricular activities to enhance overall development.
*   **Ensure Children Have Quality Care** from within their families and communities.  The best possible way to protect children from abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence is to keep them with their families and to help caregivers take care of them.  Many of the families are under high stress from a variety of reasons such as disability or illness, poverty, which often means children do not receive the love and care they deserve.   This needs to be made possible by supporting families and working with the local government towards providing for them within the stipulations of provisions being made by the government.
*   **Endorse and elevate competencies** amongst the children and young people - such as critical thinking, creativity, ability to organize, social and communication skills, adaptability, problem solving, ability to cooperate on a democratic basis needed for actively promoting a peaceful present and shaping a just future.
*   **GCI** continues to utilize community-level base and knowledge to develop innovative interventions to ensure that women and children can access basic services such as clean water, health visitors and educational facilities, and that these services are of the quality envisaged by law and its various stipulations. At the same time, GCI also reaches out directly to women to help them to understand what they must do to ensure their children are encouraged to attend and remain in school by extending support for their fees, books and uniforms.  
*   **GCI** further intervenes on issues of domestic violence and other forms of violence meted out to women and girls, in the community.  Besides this, leadership programs are held for women to assist them to become confident women able to resist violence in its myriad forms both at home and at their workplaces.
*   50% of the children’s school fees is supported by Global Concerns India through funds raised by friends of GCI, Sansera Foundation of Sansera Engineering Pvt., Ltd., for individual students.  GCI insists that parents should pay 50% of the school fees for their children.  GCI does not believe that charity should be doled out to anyone, as this will only reduce the responsibility towards the issue at hand.
*   Keeping children in Schools is a primary activity that ensures, children are safe from being pushed into labour or sexual exploitation.  
*   **We** operate from classrooms in schools where 80 children or more are being supported with partial school fees, on all working days with support educators and guest educators on a routine basis.

## Our Activities

*   GCI has identified 750 children who have been re-admitted / enrolled into different formal schools.  These are children who are vulnerable to being trafficked and pushed into the labour market, to earn a little extra income for their families.  
*   All these children belong to very poor families, whose parents are coolies, daily wage earners, domestic workers, house-painters, sell fruits-vegetables, lorry cleaners and some who work as cleaners/cooks/helpers in small hotels.  Most of the children’s fathers are alcoholics, who may or may not be living with the family; often absenting themselves from any form of regular work and so no regular income to the family.  
*   Several of the children’s only incentive to go to school is to have the mid-day meal provided by the government.  The schools have their own system of extending mid-day meals to 1 or 2 children from a family.  If a family has 3-4 children, 1 or 2 children must starve or wait till the other siblings bring back some of the food given in the schools.  **This is one of the reasons for providing a snack and some milk for children attending the ‘ALP’ classes.**
*   GCI further strives to make learning a joyful and enriching experience – encompassing all the above-mentioned issues / topics / subjects and focus areas, including vocational training, outdoor leadership camps, select adolescents to pursue artistic potentials – art, drama, music etc., at the ALP – assisted learning center
*   Through volunteers and special program activities, training workshops are periodically facilitated for children, youth and women and parents to understand the needs and challenges of adolescents in formal schooling and the effects of domestic abuse and violence  
*   Mainstream children who are differently-abled – into formal schools and vocational training 
*   Endorse and elevate competencies amongst the children and young people - such as critical thinking, creativity, ability to organize, social and communication skills, adaptability, problem solving, ability to cooperate on a democratic basis needed for actively promoting a peaceful present and shaping a just future.
*   Children rescued from brothels / workplaces are also admitted to registered homes and enrolled into formal schools for continuing their education.
*   Parents of the students supported for school fees attend monthly meetings to discuss their children’s progress, their own concerns, issues at workplaces or even to collectivize to demand entitlements from the government like, health service, minimum wages, better roads, clean drinking water and safety of children and women.
