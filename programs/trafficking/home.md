<h2 class="in-page">Combatting Human Trafficking</h2>

GCI's emphasis remains on addressing violence against women and children, living in vulnerable situations of violence, conflict or allied challenges.

Human trafficking technically is labelled within the realms of organised crimes. Crimes of sexual exploitation, organ trade, pornography and forced/bonded labour through the trafficking of people. Hence GCI works with a network of CSOs & the Govt. to combat these Crimes, and catalysing all facets of these Crimes to ensure victims and survivors have access to justice and restoration of their lives.

GCI is passionately committed to the prevention, rescue, protection, prosecution, home placement, and rehabilitation of children and individuals, prosecuting those perpetrators who would exploit themed through human trafficking. By partnering with various government departments, we ensure effective intervention in trafficking cases at all levels.

As a vital member of the State High Power Committee and the State District (Bengaluru Urban) Legal Services Authority Against Human Trafficking, GCI plays a crucial role in shaping policies. Our involvement in discussions with policymakers, civil society organizations (CSOs), international bodies, and corporations serves to raise awareness and drive action against exploitation and slavery. Together, we strive to create spaces that will ensure a future where everyone is free from the horrors of trafficking, exploitation and all forms of slavery.

Our program involves rescue, prevention, protection, prosecution, and rehabilitation in cooperation with civil society organizations working on various aspects that challenge and address human trafficking.  

GCI and its volunteers are challenging the myths, perceptions, practices, and attitudes that force children and women to be sold as commodities.
