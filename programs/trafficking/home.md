Our program involves rescue, prevention, protection, prosecution, and rehabilitation in cooperation with civil society organizations working on various aspects that challenge and address human trafficking.  

GCI and its volunteers are challenging the myths, perceptions, practices, and attitudes that force children and women to be sold as commodities.
