The Schooling Project was initiated in 2002 with support from friends of GCI, led by Suresh Venkat, Abhay Toshniwal and Nitya Rao, Tushad and Sneha Talati, Chatura Padaki, and Shabari. Their belief: that every child must have access to formal school and holistic learning to enhance their potential and inspire them to discover and follow their dreams.

In 2002 five friends pooled money to keep 10 children from vulnerable and poor families in school. Over the years the number of children steadily increased, as did the number of friends supportingthis initiative. This group supports 300 students with part school fees, uniform and books.

## What Guides Our Work

The children supported by The Schooling Project come from challenging social and economic circumstances and most often difficult family backgrounds. Many are rescued from child labour, some are rescued from trafficking, and a majority are at risk of being trafficked. Many who are forced to drop out of school, are counseled along with their families, to re-join and complete school education.

A five pronged approach continues to guide our work:

1. an integral general education, 
2. a means of preparing for occupational fields and for effective participation in the world of work 
3. an aspect of lifelong learning and a preparation for responsible citizenship with values and ethics 
4. an instrument for promoting environmentally sound sustainable development, 
5. a method of self enhancement  to facilitating poverty alleviation,
