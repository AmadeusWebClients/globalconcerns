<h2 class="in-page">The Schooling Project</h2>

### The Schooling Project is the flagship program of GCI.

We believe that **education** is the most important requirement to build positively contributing citizens, upholding equality of all people and learning to live in harmony with the **environment**. <!--TODO: grammar-->

The Schooling Project was initiated in 2002 with support from **friends of GCI**, led by **Suresh Venkat, Abhay Toshniwal, Snehaand Tushad Talati, Chatura Padaki and Shabari Padaki**.

Our belief is **that every child must have access to formal school and holistic learning to enhance their potential and inspire them to discover and follow their dreams**. <!--TODO: grammar-->

In the beginning five friends pooled money to keep 10 children from vulnerable and poor families in school. Over the years the number of children steadily increased, as did the number  of friends supporting. 300 children are supported with school fees, uniform and note books.

The children supported by The Schooling Project come from challenging circumstances and difficult backgrounds. Many are rescued from child labour, some are rescued from trafficking, and a majority are at risk of being trafficked.  Many have been forced to drop out of school and are counselled, along with their families, to re-join school.

Since 2013, the Sansera Foundation of Sansera Engineering supports 450 children annually, in 10 schools.

_Since 2003, The Schooling project has succeeded in supporting_:

* **8975** students complete formal schooling till class 10
