<h2 class="in-page">The Schooling Project</h2>

### The Schooling Project is the flagship program of GCI.

We believe that education is the most important requirement to build our nationsâ€™ foundation for an equal, prosperous, harmonious society.

The Schooling Project was initiated in 2002 with support from **friends of GCI**, led by **Suresh Venkat, Abhay Toshniwal and Nitya Rao, Tushad and Sneha Talati, Chatura and Shabari Padaki**.

Their belief: **that every child must have access to formal school and holistic learning to enhance their potential and inspire them to discover and follow their dreams**.

In the beginning five friends pooled money to keep 10 children from vulnerable and poor families in school. Over the years the number of children steadily increased, as did the number  of friends supporting (now approximately 400).

These five friends were joined by the **Sansera Foundation**, the Charitable Trust of Sansera Engineering. The trust supports 400 children annually. Sansera has been supporting students identified and rescued by GCI since 2013.

The children supported by The Schooling Project come from challenging circumstances and difficult backgrounds. Many are rescued from child labour, some are rescued from trafficking, and a majority are at risk of being trafficked.  Many have been forced to drop out of school and are counselled, along with their families, to re-join school.

_Since 2003, The Schooling project has succeeded in supporting_:

* **8975** students complete formal schooling till class 10
* **2995** complete graduation
* **2120** complete II PUC with 2 rank holders
* **1085** join community college, vocational training
* **3660** girls and **2410** boys participate in education and
* **1600** children from impoverished communities continue their scholastic education in twenty schools in Bangalore, Nelamangala, and Srinivaspura thanks to Sansera Foundation.
