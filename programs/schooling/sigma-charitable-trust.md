**Sigma Raghava Daya Charitable Trust** believes in the potential of every child that is enhanced with education. In our country, many families continue to bear the brunt of poverty and joblessness, unable to extend schooling to children.

SRDCT is keen to share with students the support required to remain and excel in scholastics and allied fields, so as to discover their capabilities and be the tool to create pathways to brighten their future.

Education is a fundamental right that enables children to break the cycle of poverty, pursue their dreams, and become positively contributing citizens. Children equipped with education are the pride of families, communities, and the nation.

To bring change and provide children the opportunity to be educated, M.C.Agarwal and his wife Sigrid Agarwal of the Sigma Trust sponsor 30 students selected from four different schools.

GCI follows up with the students daily to ensure children get the necessary assistance to complete their school work and be motivated to pursue their goals.
