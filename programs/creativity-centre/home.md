<h2 class="in-page">Ananya Children's Creativity Centre </h2>

Our **Ananya Children's Creativity Centre** opened in L.R. Nagar in March of 2020.

Ananya supports children from ages 4-15 years every day.

Since August 2020 we have been facilitating online classes for students in high school, as many students do not have access to internet, computers, or mobile phones.

A team of volunteer Mentors conduct various scholastic and life-long learning sessions for children.

The land for the Centre was purchased with funds raised in 2011 by friends of GCI who organized a Golf Tournament in Bangalore. In 2018 the Southern Lodge of Freemasons stepped up with the funds needed for constructing the building itself.

Basis Education Foundation (Basis) funded doors, windows, electrical wiring, and sanitary fittings on the first floor.

Basis, in partnership with Maarga, is running a **Basis Learning Centre** at Ananya. 

In November 2021 they kicked off our Sanmathi Ethical Digital Literacy program.

The goal: to give children and youth between the ages of 13-18 digital skills and the wisdom needed to integrate the technology of our times into their thinking and decision-making.
