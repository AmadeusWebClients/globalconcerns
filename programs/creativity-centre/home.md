<h2 class="in-page">Ananya Children's Creativity Centre </h2>

Our **Children's Creativity Centre** opened in L.R. Nagar in March of 2020.

Global Concern India (GCI) through its flagship program The Schooling Project, works to promote and encourage scholastic education among children  from especially marginalized and vulnerable communities in our society, including children rescued and those-at-risk of being trafficked, children forced to labour, beg and school dropouts.

Global Concerns India (GCI) facilitates an 'after-school-sessions' called 'Assisted Learning Program', that augments scholastic education. The sessions are conducted inside the govt. aided schools premises and at the Centre in a slum (L.R.Nagar). This involves endorsing and elevating competencies of children and young people on creativity, critical thinking, ability to organize, social and communication skills, adaptability, problem-solving, ability to cooperate on a democratic basis, and actively promote interactions that are respectful and dignified. A team of volunteer Mentors conduct scholastic and life-long learning sessions for children.
